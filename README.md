# Lab: AI-Assisted Testing 

## Overview

AI can speed up testing by finding missing cases and weak areas in a codebase. It is especially useful when the system is large or unfamiliar.

It can: 

- Find missing test paths
- Detect edge cases early
- Highlight weak test coverage

For this page, we will use a simple task tracking system as an example to see how AI can help improve testing. 

<!-- This program stores tasks and their statuses, but has limited tests and coverage. -->

<!-- See the scripts here: [Github](https://github.com/joseeden/labs-ai-assisted-testing) -->

Project structure:

```
project/
├── initial
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── task_store.py
```

`task_store.py` contains the main class that manages tasks. It stores tasks in a list and provides basic operations. This file represents the “data layer” of the system and is intentionally simple so testing issues are easy to observe.

```python
## task_store.py
class TaskStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []

    def add_task(self, task_id, name, done=False):
        self.tasks.append({
            "id": task_id,
            "name": name,
            "done": done
        })

    def get_task(self, task_id):
        for task in self.tasks:
            if task["id"] == task_id:
                return task
        return None

    def mark_done(self, task_id):
        for task in self.tasks:
            if task["id"] == task_id:
                task["done"] = True
                return True
        return False
```

`app.py` uses `TaskStore` to simulate a small workflow. This acts as the “runner” that exercises the system. It adds tasks, retrieves them, and marks them as done. 

```python
## app.py
from task_store import TaskStore

def run_app():
    store = TaskStore()

    for i in range(1000):
        store.add_task(i, f"Task {i}")

    store.get_task(10)
    store.mark_done(10)

    return store

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_app()
    print("App finished")
```

Run the app:

```bash
python3 initial/app.py  
```

Output:
```bash
App finished 
```

Even though output is simple, the system does a lot of work under the hood. It inserts 1000 tasks, retrieves one, and marks it as done. This creates many potential paths and edge cases that may not be fully tested.


## Testing Maturity

We can use AI to evaluate testing quality using a simple scoring system. This makes the output structured and easy to act on.

- Critical paths get a score
- Edge cases are measured
- Automation level is assessed

Sample prompt: 

> You are a senior QA Engineer.  
> 
> Evaluate the testing quality of this codebase and identify the high-risk areas. Score them based on a 0-5 scale:
> 
> - Coverage of critical paths
> - Handling of edge cases
> - Regression protection
> - CICD automation
>
> Lastly, identify the test types currently present and any major gaps in the testing strategy.

The model reviews the code and assigns scores for each area, which helps reveal where testing is weak or incomplete. 

Sample output:

```text
Testing Quality Scores:

* Coverage of critical paths — 1 / 5
* Handling of edge cases — 0 / 5
* Regression protection — 0 / 5
* CI/CD automation — 0 / 5

Test Types Currently Present:

* Manual execution (script-based smoke testing)

Major Gaps in Testing Strategy:

* No automated test suite (no pytest/unittest)
* No assertions or validation checks
* No edge case or failure testing
* No regression protection
* No CI/CD pipeline integration
```

Based on this, we can see that critical paths are barely tested, edge cases are not tested at all, and there is no automation or regression protection. This gives us a clear starting point for improving the testing strategy.

## Coverage Analysis

Coverage tools show which parts of the code were actually executed during tests. This helps identify hidden gaps where code runs in production but is never validated.

Install the coverage tool:

```bash
pip install coverage
```

In the example below, we measure execution coverage:

```bash
coverage run initial/app.py
coverage report -m
```

After running the tool, we get a report similar to this:

```bash
Name                    Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
-----------------------------------------------------
initial/app.py             11      0   100%
initial/task_store.py      16      2    88%   16, 23
-----------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                      27      2    93%
```

This shows that the `app.py` is fully covered, but `task_store.py` has some missing lines. Specifically, lines 16 and 23 are not executed during tests, which means those paths are not validated. 

<!-- We can connect the coverage results back to the actual functions in the codebase:

`task_store.py`

- `add_task()` → usually covered (called from app.py)
- `get_task()` → executed but not asserted
- `mark_done()` → executed but not validated

`app.py`

- `process_tasks()` → fully executed loop
- No assertions → no verification layer exists

Based on this, we can see that while some code is executed, there are no assertions or checks to confirm that it behaves correctly. This highlights the need for better test design, not just execution. -->

## Building a Test Strategy

Different types of testing can be combined to fully protect the system. 

| Test Type           | Purpose / Description      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Exploratory testing | Finds unexpected behavior  |
| Functional testing  | Checks expected outputs    |
| Regression testing  | Protects existing features |
| Automated testing   | Ensures fast feedback      |


## Generating a Test Suite

A **test suite** is a collection of structured tests that verify system behavior over time. AI can generate these tests step by step based on the code. Using the coverage report, we can focus on areas with low coverage to maximize impact.

Sample prompt:

> You are a senior software engineer with expertise in testing and quality assurance. 
>
> Generate unit and integration tests for this codebase. They should include:
>
> - Normal cases
> - Edge cases 
> - Error cases 
> - Clear assertions 
>
> List each generated tests in a table format and provide a one-line description for each. 


The model generates tests that cover normal operations, edge cases, and error conditions. In my case, it generated a new script. 

**UPDATE:** During this lab, I have updated the codebase. To keep the original files, I created another folder called "optimized" which contains the updated code. The "initial" folder contains the original code. 

```bash
project/

| test_run_app_integration    | Integration test | Verifies full workflow from add → update → done                            |
| test_run_app_large          | Integration test | Checks system behavior through full application workflow                   |
| test_process_tasks          | Integration test | Validates batch processing flow using process_tasks function               |

Before running the test, make sure you have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
``` 

Run the tests with coverage (this runs the tests on the code in the "optimized" folder):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=optimized coverage run -m pytest -vv tests/test_task_store.py
```

Output:

```bash

========================================  10 passed in 0.51s =============================================================================
```

This confirms that all generated tests are passing and the system behaves as expected under the tested conditions.


## Improving Coverage Results

After adding tests, coverage is re-run to measure how much of the code is executed by the test suite. Since tests were executed with coverage enabled, the report can be generated directly.

```bash
coverage report -m
```

Output:

```bash
Name                       Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
--------------------------------------------------------
optimized/app.py              21      1    95%   34
optimized/task_store.py       13      0   100%
tests/test_task_store.py      54      0   100%
--------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                         88      1    99%
```

The results show that `task_store.py` is fully covered, and most of `app.py` is also covered by tests. Only one line remains untested.

If we review the `optimized/app.py` file, the missing line is the script entrypoint:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main() 
```

This block is not executed during testing because the module is imported by `pytest` instead of being run directly. As a result, it is commonly excluded from coverage unless explicitly tested through script execution.

In practice, this is expected behavior, and coverage close to 100% usually indicates that the actual application logic is fully tested even if small entrypoint sections remain unexecuted.


## Adding Runtime Protections

Even after improving performance and testing, the system still assumes that all input is valid. AI can help identify missing validation and add runtime protections to make the application more robust.

Sample prompt:

> You are a senior software engineer with expertise in writing robust and secure code.
> Your task is to add runtime protections to the system to handle custom input safely.
> - Validate all input parameters for type, required fields, and value
> - Add clear error messages for invalid input
> - Verify schemas where applicable, never assume upstream data is clean
> - Provide safe defaults and fallback behavior instead of undefined states

In my case, the model added input validation to the `TaskStore` class before storing the task.

**Note:** The code updated with the runtime protections are stored in the "runtime-protection" folder.

```bash
project/
|
├── initial
│   ├── app.py
│   └── task_store.py
|
├── optimized
│   ├── app.py
│   └── task_store.py
|
├── runtime-protection
│   ├── app.py
│   └── task_store.py
|
└── tests
    └── test_task_store.py   
    └── test_runtime_protections.py   ← NEW FILE (tests for runtime protections)   
```

**Before**: The optimized `task_store.py` in `optimized/task_store.py` had no input validation, so any type of data could be added as a task.

```python
    def add_task(self, task_id, name):
        self.tasks[task_id] = {
            "id": task_id,
            "name": name,
            "done": False
        }

    def get_task(self, task_id):
        return self.tasks.get(task_id)

    def mark_done(self, task_id):
        if task_id in self.tasks:
            self.tasks[task_id]["done"] = True
            return True
        return False
```

**After:** The updated `task_store.py` in `runtime-protection/task_store.py` now includes input validations.

```python
    def add_task(self, task_id, name):
        if not isinstance(task_id, int):
            raise ValueError("task_id must be an integer")

        if not isinstance(name, str):
            raise ValueError("name must be a string")

        if not name.strip():
            raise ValueError("name cannot be empty")

        self.tasks[task_id] = {
            "id": task_id,
            "name": name,
            "done": False
        }

    def get_task(self, task_id):
        if not isinstance(task_id, int):
            raise ValueError("task_id must be an integer")

        return self.tasks.get(task_id)

    def mark_done(self, task_id):
        if not isinstance(task_id, int):
            raise ValueError("task_id must be an integer")

        if task_id in self.tasks:
            self.tasks[task_id]["done"] = True
            return True

        return False
```

The updated version prevents invalid data from entering the system and provides clear error messages when incorrect input is supplied.

To test the new runtime protections, we can run specific tests that check for invalid input handling. For this example, I've created to test script `test_runtime_protections.py` under the "tests" folder.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=runtime-protection pytest -vv tests/test_runtime_protections.py
```

Output:

```bash

```

This shows that all tests for the runtime protections are passing, which confirms that the new input validations are working as intended and the system is now more robust against invalid input.

## Automating Tests with CI

Finally, tests should run automatically whenever code changes. AI can help generate a simple CI setup for this.

Sample prompt:

> Create a minimal CI configuration that runs all tests automatically whenever code changes are pushed. The CI should:
> - Trigger on every push and pull request to the repository
> - Install dependencies
> - Use Python 3.8 or higher
> - Run all test suites and report results clearly


For this Github repository, the AI model generated a Github Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) that runs tests on every push and pull request. The workflow installs dependencies, sets up Python, and executes the test suite with coverage.

**Note 1:** The tests in the CI workflow are run on the "runtime-protection" version of the code to ensure that all new protections are validated in the automated pipeline.

**Note 2:** In actual implementation, you may want to run CI on specific branches instead of all branches to avoid unnecessary runs. Below is an example of a more targeted CI trigger configuration.

```yaml
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
      - "feature/**"

  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
```

In our case, we'll just keep it simple and trigger on all pushes and pull requests for lab purposes.

To trigger CI properly on a pull request, we must first create a new branch from our repo. 

```bash
git checkout -b ci-test
```

Confirm that the new branch is created and that you are on the new branch:

```bash
git branch
```

Output:

```bash
* ci-test
  master
```

Create an empty commit:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger CI pipeline" 
```

Push branch:

```bash
git push origin ci-test
```

Checking the **Actions** tab in Github, we should see the workflows are triggered on every push in all branches.

After creating the pull request, we can see that the CI workflow is triggered again for the pull request.

If all the tests pass, we will see a green checkmark next to the workflow in the pull request, which indicates that the code changes are validated by the test suite. 

Click **Merge pull request** to merge the changes into the main branch.

## From Testing to Security

A well-tested system can still be insecure, so testing alone is not enough. Security-first development adds a layer that focuses on preventing vulnerabilities before deployment.

With AI-assisted security reviews, we can ask the model to act like an application security engineer and evaluate risks using known vulnerability frameworks.

Sample prompt:

> You are an application security engineer.
> Review this codebase and identify common vulnerabilities and security risks based on CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses.
> 
> For each finding, include:
> - Location in code
> - Description of the issue
> - Severity level (High, Medium, Low)
> - Minimal proof of concept input to trigger the issue
> - Suggested remediation steps
> 
> Print the results in a table format.  

The AI returns a prioritized list of issues that can be used as a checklist for further validation.

**Note:** The table format may not be perfectly rendered in this markdown, but the idea is to have a structured output that clearly identifies each issue.

To ensure the issues are not only theoretical, we need to validate the AI findings using real security scanning tools. 

| Tool      | Purpose                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Pip-audit | Checks dependency vulnerabilities |
| Semgrep   | Detects insecure code patterns    |

Install both tools:

```bash
pip install pip-audit semgrep
```

Run `pip-audit` inside your project environment:

```bash
pip-audit
```

Sample output:

```bash
Found 15 known vulnerabilities in 3 packages
Name       Version ID               Fix Versions
---------- ------- ---------------- ------------
pip        22.0.2  PYSEC-2023-228   23.3
pip        22.0.2  PYSEC-2023-228   23.3
pip        22.0.2  CVE-2025-8869    25.3
pip        22.0.2  CVE-2026-1703    26.0
pip        22.0.2  CVE-2026-3219    26.1
pip        22.0.2  CVE-2026-6357    26.1
pyjwt      2.12.1  PYSEC-2026-179   2.13.0
pyjwt      2.12.1  PYSEC-2026-175   2.13.0
pyjwt      2.12.1  PYSEC-2026-177   2.13.0
pyjwt      2.12.1  PYSEC-2026-178   2.13.0
setuptools 59.6.0  PYSEC-2022-43012 65.5.1
setuptools 59.6.0  PYSEC-2022-43012 65.5.1
setuptools 59.6.0  PYSEC-2025-49    78.1.1
setuptools 59.6.0  PYSEC-2025-49    78.1.1
setuptools 59.6.0  CVE-2024-6345    70.0.0  
```

Next, use `semgrep` to analyze your codebase:

```bash
semgrep scan
```

<div class='img-center'>

![](/gif/docs/05062026-ai-assisted-semgrep-scan.gif)

</div>

To save the results in a file, you can use the `--json` flag (use `-f json` for `pip-audit`):

```bash
semgrep scan --json > semgrep_results.json

pip-audit -f json > pip_audit_results.json
```

Since scanner outputs can be large and complex, AI can help interpret the results by summarizing them and grouping issues by severity and effort required to fix. 

Sample prompt:

> Attached are the scan outputs.
> Interpret the results and classify findings by effort and severity, and use their official naming and classification where applicable.
> 
> Group the findings into:
> 
> - Quick fixes (low effort, high impact)
> - Medium effort
> - Long-term improvements (high effort, high impact)

Once issues are identified, the next step is to apply secure coding practices. This ensures fixes address the root cause instead of applying temporary patches.

## Automating Security Checks

Security checks should run automatically to prevent regressions. This is done by integrating validation tools into CI pipelines.

In this example, I've modified the existing `.github/workflows/tests.yml` to include security scanning steps. The updated workflow runs both `pip-audit` and `semgrep` as part of the CI process. 

<!-- Note that `pip-audit` is designed to fail CI when vulnerabilities are detected, while `semgrep` can be configured to report issues without necessarily failing the build, depending on the severity of the findings. -->

Since we know that our codebase has known vulnerabilities, the build **should** fail, which indicates that the CI security gate is working as intended. 

- Vulnerable dependency = block merge
- Security issue = pipeline failure

To fix this, you can simply create a `requirements.txt` file with the software dependencies and their versions.

```bash
## requirements.txt
pytest
coverage
pip-audit
pyjwt==2.13.0
```

Then update the workflow file to install dependencies from `requirements.txt` before running the security scans.

```yaml
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install pipx
        pipx install semgrep
```          

**EDIT:** Dependency installation fails when `semgrep` is included in the `requirements.txt` file. This is because it requres a native binary called `semgrep-core` which is not is not available in the GitHub runner environment during `pip install`. As a workaround, it is installed separately using `pipx`.

Once the changes are pushed, the CI pipeline will run again. This time, it should pass the dependency audit since we have updated the vulnerable package versions.

The static security scan with `semgrep` reports any code patterns that match known vulnerabilities. If any critical issues are found, the build will fail, which prevents merging insecure code into the main branch.
